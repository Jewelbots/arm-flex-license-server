To get this working, you'll need to get a license file from the ARM people. You'll also need a lot of other stuff to get it to actually work as a license server, but I'll fill you in as we go.

For now, this is pushed because it demonstrates that I can't get `docker-compose` to give the container the right hostname. :-/


###Prerequisites
 - Have docker-engine and docker-compose installed
